		<p>Convert from English to Gungan. Gungan Basic, also called Gunganese, was the language spoken by the Gungans of the planet Naboo. It was a language mostly derived from Naboo settlers' language, Basic, spoken in an accent. Occasionally, a word from Old Gungan would appear in dialogue, a term usually without any obvious meaning unless translated.
